Here is the source code of my portfolio. This website is built by html and css, without javascript.

home.html is a blank page with no content.

about.html shows my introduction, skills and work history.

contact.html shows my phone number and email. The submit button is useless right now.

work.html desmonstrates some of my work built by html5 and css3.
